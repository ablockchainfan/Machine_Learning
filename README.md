I will be doing 100 days of Machine learning, an hour a day

### Jan 4th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM from Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
   
   Thoughts: Really fun! I can't wait to do continue tomorrow! 
   
  Basic Git commands to remember:
   ```
   git add . 
   git commit -m "..."
   git push
   git status
   ```

### Jan 5th 2019:
   **Learned Classification ML Models**- Kernel SVM from Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
   
   Thoughts: Got a lot more complex. Very intersting! (Remembe to make a file with coding necessities)
